# AI-Powered Drug Discovery and Development

This project focuses on accelerating drug discovery using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques. Utilizing the Delaney (ESOL) solubility dataset, we implement Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GraphConv) to predict molecular properties critical for drug development.
