# Ai-Driven-Drug-Discovery
This repository contains the code and resources for an AI-powered drug discovery project focused on predicting molecular properties using deep learning. Leveraging the Delaney (ESOL) solubility dataset, it implements Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GraphConv) to accelerate drug development pipelines.
